				<h1 class = "title1-Head"> NATURAL WONDERS </h1>
				<p  class = "text1-Subtitle" > Natural wonders are the polar opposite of man-made structures. The surrounding all living and non-living entities that exist naturally, which means that they are not created artificially; while developing its form overtime to produce an spectacular panoramic view over the horizon. The phrase is most commonly used to refer to the Earth or sections of the Earth. The interplay of all living species, climate, weather, and natural resources that impact human success and economic activity throughout time is referred to as the atmosphere. Thus, in concept, it might generate marvelous things out of nothing, resulting in what we now refer to as the natural wonders of the world. </p>

				<h1 class = "title2-subHead"> 2. Giant's Causeway, Ireland </h1>
				<p  class = "text1-Subtitle" > The Giant's Causeway is located in The northern part of Ireland at the foot of the basalt cliffs along the sea coast on the edge of the Antrim plateau. It is made up of 40,000 huge black basalt columns that protrude from the sea. Legends of giants marching over the sea to Scotland have been inspired by the stunning sight. Geological investigations of these rocks over the last 300 years have considerably contributed to the advancement of the earth sciences, demonstrating that this stunning landscape was produced by Tertiary volcanic activity 50–60 million years ago. </p>
				<p  class = "text1-Subtitle" > The structure's accessible array of unusual geological exposures and polygonal columnar structures produced roughly 60 million years ago make it a "classic site" for basaltic volcanism research. The characteristics of the Giant's Causeway and Causeway Coast site, particularly various strata revealed in the cliff faces, has played an important role in defining our knowledge of the sequences of activity in Earth's geological history. </p>

The park is famous worldwide mostly for pillar rock formations. The pillar rock formations are unlike typical eroded limestone pillars. The pillar rock formations are made of quartz-sandstone and created as a result of physical erosion induced by heavy rainfall. The sceneries generated by mountains, pillar rock formations, lush woods, and clouds are the pinnacle of Chinese landscapes that inspire a wide range of artwork. </p>

The northern lights float over the sky, emitting a diffused glow along the northern horizon. </p>
				<p  class = "text1-Subtitle" > The intensity of anything resembling the northern lights increases as one travels north towards the magnetic pole in the Arctic. Unfortunately, the northern lights appear at random, making them difficult to see on a quick journey. Locals in such northern areas are more likely to come upon them. Viewing the Northern Lights is especially popular in Canada's far north, Alaska, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Finland.  Seeing the Northern Lights becomes much likely throughout the winter months. They occur all year, but the darker skies of winter make them more visible. </p>

It was dubbed one of the world's natural beauties since people watched its birth and quick growth. A twelve-mile round-trip hike and perhaps even horse ride to the volcano's top is possible. Hikers will traverse sandy banks and lava fields as they make their way around the volcano. </p>
