												<!-- Description -->
				
				<img src = "img-biolumiscentBeach/3.jpg" class = "img-Ref">
				
				<span class = "underLinePassive"> <h1 class = "title2-subHead"> Details </h1> </span>
				
				<p  class = "text1-Subtitle" > <span class = "spanClassSubText"> This glow-in-the-dark effect is caused due to some kind of natural phenomena known as 'Bioluminescence,' in which light is released or created by a living thing. Furthermore, the water is huge, enigmatic, and full of unknown organisms; it is thought that some aquatic critters are capable of creating light. As a result, the light created at Mudhdhoo Beach (Vaadhoo Beach) is attributable to these creatures, which illuminate the sea's shorelines in a most magnificent way. It's an otherworldly phenomenon for which people go from near and far, and there's a reason why couples love to spend their honeymoon here.  </span> </p> 
				<p  class = "text1-Subtitle" > <span class = "spanClassSubText">  The beach is located on Vaadhoo Island, which itself   is part of the Maldives' Raa Atoll. In reality, it is a little island with a population of no more than 500 people. However, the island has earned a spot on the world tourism map as a consequence behind the Sea of Stars phenomena. For a long time, this island was one of Maldives' best kept secrets, but now it is now one of the most popular spots to visit in Maldives. </span> </p> 
													
													<!-- History -->
				
				<img src = "img-biolumiscentBeach/1.jpg" class = "img-Ref">
				
				<span class = "underLinePassive"> <h1 class = "title2-subHead"> History </h1> </span>
				<p  class = "text1-Subtitle" > <span class = "spanClassSubText"> This astounding sparkling shoreline is generated by phytoplankton / plankton, a microorganism. These aquatic bacteria are bioluminescent, emitting a vivid blue light beneath the surface of the water. Its lighting process entails a great deal of molecular chemistry, and this phenomenon entices us to be a part of this magnificent activity and capture the moment forever.  The view will give an impression that stars are descending to honor the water with their presence.  Swim in the ocean or simply stroll down the beach, leaving your brilliant impression to be washed away eventually by sea water.  </span> </p>
				
		
											<!-- Physical Features -->
				
				<img src = "img-biolumiscentBeach/4.jpeg" class = "img-Ref">
				
				<span class = "underLinePassive"> <h1 class = "title2-subHead"> Physical Features </h1> </span>
				<p  class = "text1-Subtitle" > <span class = "spanClassSubText"> The bioluminescent creatures, which are ostracod crabs, produce light that shines like stars on the shoreline. As a result of this, the bright beach phenomenon develops. The coastline looks to have been showered with azure radioactive fairy dust as a result of a bioluminescent critter eruption. The beach continues to progressively lighten even the waves wash onshore. This brilliant beach is genuinely amazing; simply hearing about it or seeing photographs of it does not give it credit. Despite its appearance of a chemical spill, swimming in the water during bioluminescence is totally safe. Phytoplankton emit light for only a split second, while ostracods make the enchantment linger for seconds, minutes, and even hours. </span> </p>
				<p  class = "text1-Subtitle" > <span class = "spanClassSubText"> When anything enters the water, ostracods emit light, whereas phytoplankton emit light from their cells when they are agitated or there is an upheaval in the water. Given that this happens in less than a second, the phytoplankton emit a substantial quantity of light since they are easily unsettled: a wave, a kayak, or simply moving the water would suffice. It's known popularly as the 'firefly effect.'  </span> </p>
