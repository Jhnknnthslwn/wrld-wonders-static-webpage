				<p  class = "text1-Subtitle" > <span class = "spanClassSubText"> Glenbrittle on Skye is home to the Fairy Pools. The Fairy Pools are stunning rock pools of crystal clear spring water fed by a succession of waterfalls from the Cuillin Mountains. These Fairy Pools are located near Carbost in Glenbrittle on the Isle of Skye. Glenbrittle runs about south to north along the Brittle River, with the Cuillin mountains in the background. Many tributaries of the River Brittle flow into the glen from the Cuillin, including the Fairy Pools, a popular walking destination. The Fairy Ponds are quite a collection of spectacular waterfall-fed rock pools filled with crystal pure spring water. </span> </p> 
				<p  class = "text1-Subtitle" > <span class = "spanClassSubText"> Tourists may either walk the 2.4km gravel path from the car park to the Fairy Pools, which is surrounded by grass, heather, peat, and rocks, or they can go on to explore some of the lesser pools that lie ahead. The Fairy Pools' water is extremely transparent, making it excellent for any bold swimmers brave enough to brave the frigid waters. It is suggested that you bring a wetsuit for this activity because these beautiful rock pools may become rather cold. </span> </p> 
		
													<!-- History -->
				
				<img src = "img-fairyPools/3.jpg" class = "img-Ref">
				
				<span class = "underLinePassive"> <h1 class = "title2-subHead"> History </h1> </span>
				<p  class = "text1-Subtitle" > <span class = "spanClassSubText"> Although it is now tranquil, the Fairy Pools were the scene of the final and fiercest Battle of Coire na Creiche, fought between the MacLeods of Dunvegan and the MacDonalds of Sleat. The MacDonalds won, but the conflict was so terrible and far too many people were murdered that Allt Coir a 'Mhadaidh (the Fairy Pools) became scarlet with blood. This folklore may have some reality to it, as the Scottish Crown was shocked enough by the conflict to intervene and compel a ceasefire between the contending clans, who never went to war with one another again. </span> </p>
				<p  class = "text1-Subtitle" > <span class = "spanClassSubText"> According to the mythology, an ancient Clan MacLeod chief married a fairy princess, giving origin to several fairy place names on the Isle of Skye. It is also stated that Fairy Pools drew selkies. These fabled beings, disguised as huge seals during the day, would travel to the beach at the foot of Glen Brittle where they would shed their skins and transform into human shape for the night, bathing in the pools under the light of a full moon. </span> </p>

				<span class = "underLinePassive"> <h1 class = "title2-subHead"> Physical Features </h1> </span>
				<p  class = "text1-Subtitle" > <span class = "spanClassSubText"> The Fairy Pools are on the Scottish Isle of Skye, part of the Inner Hebrides, where North Atlantic currents keep temperatures moderate and pleasant all year. They are a composition of ponds, streams, and a waterfall in the middle behind the Glen Brittle woods that provide spectacular splendor. The Fairy Pools, as their names suggest, are supposed to be magical in some way. Finally, the beautiful photos of the pools and surrounding landscape might be attributed to the "magical" mood. These pools are swimmable, and they're a great place to spend time with family and friends. And with their stunning features, they attract a large number of hikers to the area. To get to the Fairy Pools, a twenty-minute stroll through Scotland's wild splendor is required. </span> </p>
